## origins

As with most origin stories, this one has been reimagined multiple times and will likely continue to be as certain moments seem to hold more weight than others, at different points in my journey.

I mostly remember negative feelings towards formal education in general, from kindergarten on through my couple of early university tours. It was towards the end of my master's program that, as a teaching assistent, I was tasked with delivering some tutorials to a senior undergraduate class. I had never been comfortable in front of crowds, and I usually sought every way out of such requirements. I don't remember exactly how I approached getting in fron of this group of 40 high achievers, but I do remember not being so good at promoting understanding of the subject matter at the beginning. It was both intimidating and somehow exciting. I welcomed the challenge.
